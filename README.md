# Spam Detection Web App

This is an interactive Spam Detection web application built using Python and Streamlit as part of my Data Analytics learning journey. The app classifies messages as spam or not spam, applying machine learning concepts in a practical, real-world scenario.

### Overview

Spam messages are common in emails, SMS, and online platforms. Detecting them is an important use case for machine learning. This project demonstrates text classification, data preprocessing, and deployment of ML models in an accessible web app.

### Key Features

Message Classification: Classifies messages as spam or not in real time.

Interactive Interface: Built with Streamlit for easy use.

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encoding, and feature extraction for better model performance.

Machine Learning Integration: Uses supervised learning algorithms for accurate predictions.

### Skills Learned

Data Analytics: Cleaning, preprocessing, and transforming data for modeling.

Machine Learning: Training, evaluating, and using models for classification tasks.

Python Programming: Implementing ML workflows and handling datasets.

Web App Development: Deploying interactive applications with Streamlit.

### Installation & Usage

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Install dependencies listed in requirements.txt.

Run the app using:

streamlit run app.py


Enter a text message to see if it’s classified as spam or not spam.

This project showcases hands-on learning in data analytics and machine learning by turning theoretical concepts into a practical, deployable application.
